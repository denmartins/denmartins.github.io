Hi! I am a professor at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas](https://www.puc-campinas.edu.br/) (PUC-Campinas), where I conduct research in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Data-intense Systems. 

Previously, I also worked as a senior AI researcher specialist at the [Samsung R&D Institute Brazil](https://research.samsung.com/srbr), where I contributed to the design and implementation of AI models for mobile and wearable devices for fitness and healthcare applications.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Münster](https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/department/mlde/people/denis-mayr-lima-martins-1), specializing in Machine Learning and Database Systems. I hold both a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pernambuco.
