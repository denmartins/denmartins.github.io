Hi! I am a professor at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at [University of São Paulo](https://dcm.ffclrp.usp.br/) (USP), where I conduct research in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Previously, I held a professor position at [Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas](https://www.puc-campinas.edu.br/) (PUC-Campinas). 

I also worked as a senior AI researcher specialist at the [Samsung R&D Institute Brazil](https://research.samsung.com/srbr), where I contributed to the design and implementation of AI models for mobile and wearable devices for fitness and healthcare applications.
